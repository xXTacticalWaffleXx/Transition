    In this image i tried to portray the feeling of wanting to hide away and not be perceived by anyone that i felt
    when i first came out. Covering my face was something i did almost constantly, and the harsh monotone red is
    meant to depict the frantic anger and distress i felt at my new awareness of my situation.
