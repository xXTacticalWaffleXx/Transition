    In this image i tried to depict the feeling of going outside in vaguely feminine clothes for the first time
    and everyone staring at me for not wearing the "right" clothes despite me just wanting to be off to the side
    and unnoticed. Leaving the studio in the shot was an intentional choice to represent how the standards that
    were being applied to me were completely arbitrary and constructed.
